This script turns an e-Paper display into a digital nametag, and displays
a new randomly-generated name (and university affiliation) every 10 seconds.

It uses three input files:
 - `firstnames.csv`
 - `lastnames.csv`
 - `colleges.csv`

I used [this data from FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/most-common-name)
as a basis for the name lists here.

The script as written relies on my fork of [PaperTTY](https://github.com/GregDMeyer/PaperTTY),
which you need to install before running.

It also uses the font `BrownBagLunch.ttf`, which can be downloaded
[here](https://www.fontspace.com/kevin-richey/brown-bag-lunch). It was created by Kevin Richey and is
licensed as Freeware.
